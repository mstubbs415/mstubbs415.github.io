				HTML5 is much more progressive than its predecessors. With this newest verion of HTML, you can create web applications that don't require CSS, JavaScript, and other non-standard proprietary technologies. HTML5 supports high-definition audio and video, which means it can be utilized for even animation and game development. It also includes web storage, is compatible across multiple browsers, and even works offline!
